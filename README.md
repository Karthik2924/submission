# Continuous Learning
* A continuous learning task was simulated using CIFAR10 dataset in a supervised setting. 
* We first train a binary classification model for two classes from the dataset.
* We then use the same model to learn a classifier for different classes without forgetting the earlier classification task.
* The performance of the model could be improved if use a bigger model leading to sparser activations for each task.
